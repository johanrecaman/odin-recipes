    <h3>Just Basic Crepes</h3>
    <p>The Jacquin's Basic Crepes aren't an ordinary recipe, this one will receive much tompero! <br>
        Here is a simple but delicious crepe batter which can be made in minutes. It's made from ingredients 
        <br>that everyone has on hand.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients (Without Tompero)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>½ cup milk</li>
        <li>½ cup water</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Recipe Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, 
            whisk together the flour and the eggs. Gradually add in the milk and water, stirring to combine. 
            Add the salt and butter; beat until smooth.</li>

        <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto 
            the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each crepe. Tilt the pan with a circular motion so 
            that the batter coats the surface evenly.</li>

        <li>Cook the crepe for about 2 minutes, until the bottom is light brown. Loosen with a spatula, 
            turn and cook the other side. Serve hot.</li>
    </ol>
